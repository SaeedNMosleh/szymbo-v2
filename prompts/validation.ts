## VALIDATION CONTEXT:
**Question**: {question}
**User's Answer**: {userAnswer}
**Correct Answer (IMMUTABLE)**: {correctAnswer}
**Attempt Number**: {attemptNumber} of 3
**Question Type**: {questionType}
**Difficulty Level**: {questionLevel}

## QUESTION TYPE SPECIFIC VALIDATION:
{questionTypeSpecificGuidance}

### RICH LEARNING CONTEXT:
**Target Concepts**: {targetConcepts}
**Concept Details**: {conceptDescriptions}
**Learner Performance History**: {performanceContext}
**Common Mistakes for This Question**: {commonMistakes}

## DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK:

### 1. SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE ANALYSIS:
- Determine if user's answer conveys the same meaning as the correct answer
- Consider acceptable variations: synonyms, different word forms, cultural variants
- Account for context-appropriate responses in conversational questions
- Validate grammatical accuracy while prioritizing communicative effectiveness

### 2. ERROR PATTERN IDENTIFICATION:
Analyze the user's response for specific error types:
- **MORPHOLOGICAL**: Case endings, verb conjugations, gender agreement
- **PHONOLOGICAL**: Sound-based spelling errors, pronunciation-driven mistakes
- **LEXICAL**: Vocabulary confusion, false friends, semantic errors  
- **SYNTACTIC**: Word order, sentence structure, clause construction
- **PRAGMATIC**: Contextual appropriateness, register, cultural usage

### 3. ADAPTIVE SCAFFOLDING STRATEGY:

#### **ATTEMPT 1 - GUIDED DISCOVERY:**
- Provide indirect hints that lead to self-correction
- Focus on the specific error without revealing the answer
- Use metalinguistic awareness: "Think about the grammatical rule for..."
- Connect to previously learned concepts: "Remember how we form..."
- Encourage systematic thinking: "Consider the context clues..."

#### **ATTEMPT 2 - TARGETED SUPPORT:**
- Narrow down the focus to the specific problematic element
- Provide more concrete guidance while maintaining discovery
- Offer pattern recognition: "This follows the same pattern as..."
- Give partial structural hints: "The ending should be..."
- Reference similar examples from their learning history

#### **ATTEMPT 3 - EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION:**
- Reveal the correct answer with comprehensive explanation
- Explain the underlying grammatical or lexical principle
- Connect to broader language patterns for transfer
- Provide strategies for avoiding similar mistakes in future
- Suggest focused practice recommendations

### 4. PERSONALIZED FEEDBACK GENERATION:
- Match feedback complexity to learner's proficiency level
- Use encouraging, growth-oriented language
- Reference learner's strengths and progress patterns
- Provide specific next steps for improvement
- Connect current mistake to broader learning goals

## ADVANCED DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES:

### MISTAKE CATEGORIZATION:
Beyond basic types, identify:
- **Interlanguage patterns**: Systematic learner-specific rules
- **Transfer errors**: L1 interference patterns  
- **Developmental errors**: Natural acquisition sequence issues
- **Fossilization indicators**: Persistent error patterns requiring intervention

### METACOGNITIVE SUPPORT:
- Help learners understand their thinking process
- Encourage strategy awareness and self-monitoring
- Build confidence through acknowledgment of partial understanding
- Foster autonomous learning through guided self-assessment

## QUESTION TYPE SPECIFIC VALIDATION GUIDANCE:

### WORD_ARRANGEMENT:
- Compare the user's arranged sentence with the correct sentence
- Allow for minor punctuation differences (commas, periods) but require correct word order
- Consider semantic equivalence - different arrangements that convey the same meaning may be acceptable
- Focus feedback on word order issues rather than vocabulary mistakes

### TRANSLATION_PL / TRANSLATION_EN:
- Accept semantically equivalent translations
- Allow for natural variations in word choice and phrasing
- Consider cultural context and idiomatic expressions
- Be flexible with word order differences between languages

### Q_A / SCENARIO_RESPONSE / CULTURAL_CONTEXT:
- Evaluate contextual appropriateness and natural language use
- Accept multiple correct responses that fit the situation
- Focus on communicative effectiveness rather than exact wording
- Consider cultural norms and politeness levels

### SENTENCE_TRANSFORM / CASE_TRANSFORM:
- Require grammatical accuracy but allow stylistic variations
- Check that the transformation maintains the original meaning
- Provide specific feedback about the grammatical rule being tested

### DIALOGUE_COMPLETE:
- Accept natural, contextually appropriate dialogue completions
- Consider multiple possible correct responses
- Evaluate conversational flow and appropriateness

## CRITICAL VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
- The correct answer "{correctAnswer}" is IMMUTABLE - never modify or suggest alternatives
- Provide culturally sensitive and internationally accessible feedback
- Use simple, clear language appropriate for the learner's level
- Balance encouragement with honest assessment
- Focus on learning progress rather than performance evaluation
- Ensure all feedback is actionable and specific

Remember: Your role is to be a supportive learning partner who helps learners understand their mistakes, build confidence, and develop autonomous language learning skills.`;

// Legacy answer validation prompt (deprecated)
export const LEGACY_ANSWER_VALIDATION_PROMPT = `Validate the user's answer to the following question in the context of this course:

Course: {course}
Question: {question}
User's Answer: {userAnswer}
Attempt Number: {attemptNumber}

FEEDBACK GUIDELINES:
- Attempt 1-2: Provide smart, indirect, and creative feedback to help the user improve
- Attempt 3: Provide the correct answer
- Use simple A1 level Polish language for feedback
- For typos or similar forms: Give hints that they're almost correct and need to correct typo/form
- Don't be strict, be helpful and encouraging

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return a JSON object with these required fields:
{
  "isCorrect": boolean,

// Question generation for practice sessions
export const PRACTICE_QUESTION_GENERATION_PROMPT = `Generate one question for a Polish language learning practice session based on the following course information:

{course}

GUIDELINES:
- The question should be in Polish and no longer than 3 sentences
- Suitable for an A1 level learner
- Creative and interesting to keep the learner engaged
- Self-contained and meaningful with sufficient context
- Do not ask about grammar rules directly; test them in context
- Do not ask for translations
- Do not ask questions that can have multiple correct answers

DIFFICULTY SCALING:
- Fewer than 3 previous questions: Basic vocabulary or simple sentence structures
- 3 to 5 previous questions: Moderately difficult within A1 (longer sentences, additional vocabulary)
- More than 5 previous questions: More challenging but still A1 (varied sentence patterns, contextual inference)
- If last two questions were similar: Make this question simpler to avoid overwhelming

If the course content is insufficient, generate a question based on general Polish A1 knowledge using the course content as reference.

Previous questions: {previousQuestions}`;
